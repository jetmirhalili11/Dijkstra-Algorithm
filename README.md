# Dijkstra-Algorithm

Because the application was developed with a simple IDE (jGrasp) I do not guarantee that it will work on other IDE's as well.
Please do not change the names of files as that would make the application unstable.

This project uses the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest route for Kosovo cities, and presents it visually and shows the kilometers to each city along the way.

To change the project to work for another location then you need to change the code in the Graph and Window class, these changes are also mentioned in the code as comments.

All classes are written by me, so the ready code has not been received, and it is full of comments in order to be as clear as possible.
